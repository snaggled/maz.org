I'm Brian. This is the source code for my web site.

h2. How it works

The feed aggregator ("feed monster", a name stolen from my "employer":http://outside.in) that hits a number of services every 15 minutes, either fetching an Atom or RSS feed or using a custom API, depending on the service. Whatever data is pulled down gets dumped into a "MongoDB":http://mongodb.org collection, normalized as "activities".

The Rails front end just pulls the most recent activities from the collection and shows them in reverse chronological order. Rails is way overkill for this, but part of the exercise was learning how to use "MongoMapper":http://mongomapper.com.
